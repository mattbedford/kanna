# Kezuru — Roadmap

A lightweight PHP starter kit for developers who want to write PHP, not "framework".
Built on Slim 4, inspired by Japanese craft tooling philosophy: remove what's unnecessary to reveal what's underneath.

Base: [samuelgfeller/slim-starter](https://github.com/samuelgfeller/slim-starter)

## Phase 1 — Content Engine (MVP)

The core of Kezuru. A schema-driven content management system that auto-generates admin CRUD screens from simple PHP config files.

### 1.1 Schema Definition Format

Define content types as PHP arrays in `config/content/`. One file per type.

```php
// config/content/team_member.php
return [
    'label'        => 'Team Members',
    'label_single' => 'Team Member',
    'icon'         => 'users',
    'fields'       => [
        'name'       => ['type' => 'text', 'required' => true, 'label' => 'Full Name'],
        'job_title'  => ['type' => 'text', 'label' => 'Job Title'],
        'bio'        => ['type' => 'textarea', 'label' => 'Biography'],
        'headshot'   => ['type' => 'image', 'label' => 'Photo'],
        'start_date' => ['type' => 'date', 'label' => 'Start Date'],
        'website'    => ['type' => 'url', 'label' => 'Website'],
        'sort_order' => ['type' => 'number', 'label' => 'Sort Order'],
    ],
];
```

**MVP field types:**

| Type       | Renders as              | DB column    |
|------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| `text`     | `<input type="text">`   | VARCHAR(255) |
| `textarea` | `<textarea>`            | TEXT         |
| `richtext` | Textarea + simple editor| TEXT         |
| `number`   | `<input type="number">` | INTEGER      |
| `date`     | `<input type="date">`   | DATE         |
| `url`      | `<input type="url">`    | VARCHAR(500) |
| `email`    | `<input type="email">`  | VARCHAR(254) |
| `image`    | File upload + preview   | VARCHAR(500) |
| `select`   | `<select>`              | VARCHAR(255) |
| `toggle`   | Checkbox/switch         | BOOLEAN      |

### 1.2 Schema-to-Database (SchemaToTable)

- Reads content type definitions from `config/content/`
- Compares against actual database tables
- Creates or alters tables to match (prefix: `content_`)
- Runs automatically on setup, can be triggered via CLI
- Must work identically across SQLite, MariaDB, PostgreSQL

### 1.3 Schema-to-Form (FormRenderer)

- Reads content type definition
- Outputs correct HTML form fields per type
- Handles validation rules (required, max length, etc.)
- FieldTypeRegistry maps type string to renderer class
- New field types added by registering one class

### 1.4 Generic Admin CRUD

All content types share one set of actions/routes:

```
GET    /admin/content/{type}             → List view
GET    /admin/content/{type}/create      → Create form
POST   /admin/content/{type}             → Store
GET    /admin/content/{type}/{id}        → Edit form
PUT    /admin/content/{type}/{id}        → Update
DELETE /admin/content/{type}/{id}        → Delete
```

Components:
- `ContentListAction` — generic list with sortable columns from schema
- `ContentCreateAction` / `ContentStoreAction` — form + save
- `ContentEditAction` / `ContentUpdateAction` — form + save
- `ContentDeleteAction` — soft or hard delete
- `ContentRepository` — generic CRUD using query builder
- `ContentValidator` — validates input against schema rules

### 1.5 File/Image Upload

- `ImageUploadService` handles uploads to `storage/uploads/`
- Resize/thumbnail generation
- Returns stored path for DB
- Abstracted via Flysystem for future S3/CDN support (optional)

### 1.6 Admin Navigation

- Auto-generated from content type definitions
- Sidebar lists each content type with its icon and label
- "Users" module remains as-is alongside content types
- Sidebar nav items array is ready to accept injected collection entries from SchemaLoader

---

## Phase 2 — Admin UI Overhaul

### Goals
- Modern, clean, professional admin feel
- Clients see it and feel confident
- Not over-designed — just polished

### Decision: Tailwind CSS via Standalone CLI
Tabler was considered but felt too Bootstrap-heavy. Tailwind gives us modern utility-first styling without introducing Node or npm into the project. The standalone CLI binary lives at `bin/tailwindcss` and is downloaded automatically by `bin/setup.php`.

- **Source CSS:** `resources/css/app.css` (theme tokens defined here)
- **Compiled CSS:** `public/assets/css/app.css`
- **Dev workflow:** `./bin/tailwindcss -i resources/css/app.css -o public/assets/css/app.css --watch`
- **Dark mode:** Uses existing `data-theme` attribute via `@variant dark` override
- **Colour system:** Strapi-inspired tokens — `primary`, `surface`, `body`, `muted`, `danger`, etc.

### Decision: Three-Zone Template Architecture

Templates are organised into three distinct zones plus a shared directory:

```
templates/
├── account/    # Front-facing account/profile area (skeleton — rip it out and build your own)
├── admin/      # The product. Polished, fixed, works out of the box
├── front/      # Public pages (skeleton — rip it out and build your own)
└── shared/     # Partials any zone can explicitly include
```

**Admin** is "the product" — it ships polished and complete. You can customise it, but you don't need to. **Front** and **Account** are skeletons — starting points that developers are expected to replace with their own designs. **Shared** holds partials (like the asset renderer) that any zone can explicitly pull in.

Each zone has its own layout. Page templates declare their layout on line one via `$this->setLayout('admin/layout.php')`. This is deterministic — open any template, you immediately know what zone it belongs to.

### Decision: Route Groups = Zones

Zones map to Slim route groups. `/admin/*` routes use the admin layout, `/account/*` routes use the account layout, top-level routes use the front layout. The Action specifies the layout explicitly — no middleware magic, no fallbacks, no guessing.

### Decision: Icons — Ionicons (MIT, Inline SVG)

Icons are from the Ionicons set (MIT licensed), used as inline SVGs in templates. No CDN, no JS dependency, no icon font. SVGs use `stroke="currentColor"` so they inherit text colour automatically. Optimised via SVGOMG before inclusion.

### Completed

- [x] Admin layout shell (`templates/admin/layout.php`)
    - CSS Grid: fixed 260px sidebar + fluid main area
    - Main area splits into topbar (auto height) + content (fills remaining)
    - Loads zone-specific assets via shared asset renderer
    - Dark mode script fires before paint
- [x] Admin sidebar (`templates/admin/partials/sidebar.php`)
    - Dark background (`bg-sidebar`), Strapi-style
    - Brand/app name at top
    - Icon + label navigation with active state detection via route names
    - Nav items array ready for content collection injection
    - Settings link anchored at bottom
- [x] Admin topbar (`templates/admin/partials/topbar.php`)
    - Page title on the left (set by page template via `$pageTitle` variable)
    - Dark/light mode toggle with sun/moon Ionicons
    - User avatar placeholder on the right
- [x] Admin dashboard (`templates/admin/dashboard.php`)
    - Calls `$this->setLayout('admin/layout.php')` — demonstrates the zone pattern
    - Quick-link cards to available sections (Users)
    - No charts, no analytics — this is a content tool, not an ERP

### Remaining

- [ ] Wire up route (`GET /admin`) and `AdminDashboardAction` to serve the dashboard
- [ ] Move Samuel's asset renderer to `templates/shared/assets.php`
- [ ] Wire up dark mode toggle JS for admin
- [ ] Responsive sidebar (collapsible on tablet/mobile)
- [ ] Gradually replace existing Gfeller CSS with Tailwind equivalents
- [ ] Colour identity refresh (move away from Strapi's exact palette to something unique)

### Inspiration
- Strapi's clean content editing experience
- Statamic's field UI polish
- NOT WordPress. Never WordPress.

## Architecture Decision: Content Model — Collections, Not Hierarchies

Every content type in Kezuru is a flat collection. This is a deliberate departure from WordPress's approach where registering a custom post type auto-generates archive pages, tag pages, JSON API routes, and other URLs you never asked for.

In Kezuru:
- You define a collection and what fields it contains
- You query that collection in your template
- You decide what pages exist and what routes serve them
- Nothing is auto-generated. Every route is explicit

**No automatic archive pages. No automatic tag pages. No automatic JSON routes. No automatic anything.**

The developer defines the data shape. The developer defines the routes. The developer writes the template. The system is fully deterministic — if a URL exists, it's because someone deliberately created it.

This approach also means no complex parent/child hierarchies governing content. Collections are flat. If you need nesting or relationships, you model them explicitly — not through framework magic that quietly spawns pages and feeds behind your back.

---

## Phase 3 — Live Preview (The Dream)

Split-pane editing: fields on the left, front-end preview on the right.

### Architecture
- `ContentPreviewAction` — receives form data via AJAX POST
- Renders through the actual front-end template with unsaved data
- Returns HTML to an iframe in the right pane
- Debounced onChange fires preview refresh as client types

### Notes
- Does NOT need to be in MVP
- The admin content area has been designed with space to accommodate a preview pane alongside the edit form
- Preview uses same template files as the live site

---

## Phase 4 — Packaging & Distribution

### Composer create-project
```bash
composer create-project kezuru/kezuru mysite
cd mysite
php bin/setup.php
```

### bin/setup.php CLI Installer
Already implemented:
- Creates `storage/`, `storage/uploads/`, `logs/` directories
- Initialises SQLite database file
- Downloads Tailwind CSS standalone CLI (platform-detected)
- Runs initial Tailwind CSS build

Still to add:
- Run SchemaToTable against all content definitions
- Prompt for admin email + password
- Create first admin user

### Deployment
- Single directory, single process
- PHP-FPM + Caddy (auto SSL)
- SQLite for small sites, MariaDB/PostgreSQL via one config change
- No Docker required (but Dockerfile provided for those who want it)
- No Node, no build step, no compilation

---

## Phase 5 — Community Release

### Before release
- Clean README ("This is not a CMS. It's a starter kit.")
- Example content definition shipped (basic pages type)
- MIT licence
- Contributing guide
- Changelog

### Positioning
For PHP developers who:
- Want to write PHP, not "Laravel"
- Need a clean admin for client content
- Don't want WordPress's React-driven complexity
- Value simplicity, control, and independence from private equity

## Design Principles

1. **You write PHP.** Not framework DSL, not YAML incantations, not React.
2. **Template-first, API-available.** Server-rendered by default, JSON endpoints alongside for those who need them.
3. **Clients edit content.** Clean fields, clear labels, nothing they don't need.
4. **One server, one directory.** No microservices, no Docker required, no Node.
5. **Schema defines everything.** One config file per content type. The engine does the rest.
6. **Collections, not hierarchies.** Flat, deterministic content. No auto-generated pages, tags, or routes.
7. **Swap what you want.** SQLite today, PostgreSQL tomorrow. Tailwind today, custom UI tomorrow.
8. **No private equity.** MIT licensed. No "free tier" that turns paid. No rug pulls.
